                    "\u2022 It must be emphasized that heavy rainfall and severe winds may still be experienced in localities outside the landfall\npoint and the forecast confidence cone. Refer to \u201cOther Hazards affecting Land Areas\u201d for more details.\nFurthermore, the track may still shift within the limit of the forecast confidence cone.\n\u2022 WILMA is forecast to move west southwestward until tomorrow (06 December) before turning generally westward for the\nremaining forecast period. On the forecast track, the center of WILMA may make its initial landfall or pass close over Eastern\nVisayas or Dinagat Islands between this evening and tomorrow morning. Afterwards, it will continue to traverse Visayas until\nSunday (07 December). It will then emerge over Sulu Sea and may pass over northern Palawan by Monday (08 December)\nmorning.\n\u2022 WILMA will slightly intensify before landfall but will likely remain as a tropical depression throughout the forecast period.\nFurther intensification is possible once it emerges over the West Philippine Sea."
