HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS

Heavy Rainfall
· Tonight through tomorrow: Moderate to heavy rains with at times intense likely over Batanes and Babuyan Islands. Light to moderate with at times heavy rains possible over Ilocos Norte, Apayao, and Cagayan.
· Saturday early morning through afternoon: Moderate to heavy rains possible over Batanes. Light to moderate with at times heavy rains possible over Babuyan Islands.
· Under these conditions, isolated to scattered flooding (including flash floods) and rain-induced landslides are possible especially in areas that are highly or very highly susceptible to these hazard as identified in hazard maps, and in localities with significant antecedent rainfall.
· This tropical cyclone is also forecast to enhance the Southwest Monsoon which may bring rains over the western section of Luzon beginning tomorrow. As such, the issuance of Weather Advisory for Southwest Monsoon is likely.

Severe Winds
Strong winds (strong breeze to near gale strength) will be experienced within any of the areas where Wind Signal no. 1 is currently in effect. The potential for hoisting a Wind Signal No. 2 is also not ruled out.

HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
· Under the influence of Super Typhoon HENRY, a Gale Warning is in effect for the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Luzon. For more information, refer to Gale Warning #2 issued at 5:00 PM today.
· In the next 24 hours, HENRY may bring moderate to rough seas over the eastern seaboards of Isabela (2.0 to 4.0 m), Central Luzon, and Southern Luzon (1.2 to 3.0 m). These conditions may be risky for those using small seacrafts. Mariners are advised to take precautionary measures when venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigating in these conditions.

TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
· Super Typhoon HENRY is forecast to continue decelerating and may become almost stationary tomorrow morning. HENRY may begin tracking slowly northwestward by tomorrow afternoon before eventually accelerating northward by Saturday. On the forecast track, HENRY may exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Saturday evening or Sunday morning.
· This super typhoon is forecast to weaken as it continues to slow down and enter its quasi-stationary phase. A short period of intensification may also take place by Sunday as HENRY tracks northward over the East China Sea.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property...

## PDFPLUMBER EXTRACTION NOTES

### Strengths:
✅ Correctly extracts all text content
✅ Preserves multi-line cell content
✅ Handles table structures properly
✅ Extracts coordinates and measurements accurately
✅ Preserves bullet points and formatting

### Challenges:
⚠️ Table detection creates extra small tables for wrapped content (rows 2, 3, 4 in TABLE 1)
⚠️ Multi-line cells may have newline characters (`\n`) embedded
⚠️ Bullet points appear as Unicode character `\uf0b7` in table extraction
⚠️ Whitespace handling varies between text extraction and table extraction

### Key Formatting Patterns to Extract:
1. **Location:** `[distance] [direction] of [reference point], [province] ([latitude]°N, [longitude]°E)`
2. **Movement:** `[direction] at [speed] km/h`
3. **Winds:** `MSW: [value] km/h, Gust: [value] km/h, Pressure: [value] hPa`
4. **Forecast:** Multi-row cells with date/time + location + intensity data
5. **Wind Signals:** Regional table with TCWS number and affected areas
6. **Hazards:** Bullet-point format with time ranges and area specifications

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PARSING

1. **Location Extraction:**
   - Search for pattern: "Location of Center ([time])"
   - Extract next section until "Intensity"
   - Parse distance, direction, reference point, and coordinates

2. **Table Parsing:**
   - Use `extract_tables()` then filter out sub-tables with single cells
   - Handle multi-line cells by joining with appropriate delimiters
   - Extract forecast table as structured array

3. **Wind Signal Warnings:**
   - Target TCWS table specifically
   - Map regions (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao) to affected areas
   - Extract TCWS number and impact descriptions

4. **Hazard Parsing:**
   - Split by section headers: "HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS", "HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS"
   - Extract bullet points with time indicators
   - Parse measurements (rainfall, sea heights, etc.)
