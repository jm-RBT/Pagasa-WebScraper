Refer to \u201cOther Hazards affecting Land Areas\u201d for more details.\nFurthermore, the track may still shift within the limit of the forecast confidence cone.\n\u2022 WILMA is forecast to move generally westward for majority of the forecast period. On the forecast track, the center of WILMA\nmay make its initial landfall over Eastern Samar or Northern Samar tonight. Afterwards, it will continue to traverse Visayas\nuntil tomorrow (07 December). It will then emerge over Sulu Sea and may pass over northern Palawan by Monday (08\nDecember) morning.\n\u2022 WILMA will likely remain as a tropical depression throughout its passage over Visayas and Palawan. However, due to dry\nintrusion from the Northeast monsoon, there is an increasing likelihood of weakening into a remnant low while traversing the\narea of Visayas."
